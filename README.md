# Hand-Gesture-Control

Virtual Mouse and Media Player Control using Hand Gestures
Overview
This project implements a virtual mouse and media player control system that allows users to interact with their computer using hand gestures. By utilizing computer vision techniques, users can perform actions like moving the cursor, clicking, and controlling media playback (play, pause, next, previous) with simple hand movements.

Features
Virtual Mouse Control:

Move cursor using hand position
Left and right click using specific hand gestures
Scroll functionality using hand movements
Media Player Control:

Play/Pause media using hand gestures
Next/Previous track navigation
Volume control with hand positioning
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks
Mediapipe: For hand tracking
PyAutoGUI: For controlling mouse actions
Pygame or other media libraries: For media playback control
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-mouse-gesture-control.git
cd virtual-mouse-gesture-control
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer.

Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Position your hand in front of the webcam to start controlling the mouse and media player.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform gestures:

Move Cursor: Hand movement left/right/up/down
Left Click: Fist gesture
Right Click: Open hand gesture
Play/Pause: Open hand gesture with a specific finger position
Next/Previous: Swipe gestures
Demo
A video demonstration of the project can be found here.

Troubleshooting
Ensure your lighting conditions are good for better hand tracking.
Adjust the camera angle if the gestures are not recognized properly.
Check the permissions for camera access.
